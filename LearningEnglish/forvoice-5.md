"Hey George, did you hear about the new AI features that are going to take over our development workflow?"

"Yeah, I can't wait to see how it'll usher in a new era of development. By the way, how did your date go off last night?"

"Oh man, don't even ask for details. We completely fell out over dinner when she started criticizing GitHub Copilot!"

"No way! Did you tell her off?"

"I wanted to, but I had to abide by restaurant etiquette. I just pulled out my wallet and took out cash for the bill before things could boil over."

"That's rough. Let's go back to the AI topic. I heard Microsoft is trying to grow into the AI market even more."

"True. We can't let this opportunity get out of our hands. Speaking of which, can you pass on those CI/CD documentation updates to the team?"

"Sure, but I need to cut off some redundant parts first. By the way, did you drop in on yesterday's standup?"

"No, I had to turn down the meeting. My neighbor ran over my mailbox, and I had to answer for the property damage."

"That's crazy! Did you tell on them to the HOA?"

"Nah, I decided to stick by my principles and handle it directly. They offered to give away their parking spot to me as compensation."

"Oh, and before I forget - we need to use up our training budget before Q4. Want to go along with me to that AI conference?"

"Sure! Just let me put on my calendar. My ex keeps trying to be after me about our break up, so I could use the distraction."

"Perfect! And hey, don't let anyone knock back your spirits. We have in our team the best developers anyway!"

"Thanks, man. You always know how to cheer me up!"
