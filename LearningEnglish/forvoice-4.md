Hey George, how's it going on with the new GitHub Copilot features?

Actually, it's turning out better than expected! Though I had to put up with some initial bugs.

Yeah, I heard some teams had to cut out certain features temporarily. Did you come around to using the new API?

I did! But let me bring up something interesting - I fell for the AI hype at first, but now I'm trying to cool down my expectations.

Don't give up yet! I took after my mentor's advice and started small. Want to drop by my desk later? I'll show you some tricks.

Sure! But first, I need to wash up and dress up for that developer conference presentation. Can't pass up that opportunity!

Oh right! Don't let me hold up your preparation. By the way, did you hear Sarah decided to step down from the DevRel team?

No way! I need to get over that news. She always helped me fend off difficult questions during presentations.

Yeah, she could turn into a real lifesaver during tough situations. Speaking of which, did you make up your mind about that new CI/CD pipeline?

Still looking for the best solution. The current one is about to dry up, and we need to vamp up our deployment process.

Don't let me butt in, but I'd advise against using that new container service. Several startups went under using it.

Thanks for the heads up! Hey, want to go out with the team for lunch? I heard they put out a great spread at that new place.

Sure, but let me tie up some loose ends first. I need to cross off a few items from my todo list and send for some documentation updates.

No problem! I need to fill up my water bottle anyway. Oh, and I need to cover for Mike later - he came down with something.

That's rough. Hope he can get away from his desk and rest. By the way, did you pick out a theme for the next hackathon?

Still working on it. We need to allow for different skill levels and aim at increasing participation.

Makes sense. Let's press on with the planning. We can zero out the previous budget and start fresh.

Perfect! Let's bring around more teams this time. Last year's numbers didn't really add up to our expectations.

True. We should throw out the old format and turn to something more engaging. Maybe play with new concepts?

Agreed! Well, I should drop off these reports before lunch. Hang on - did you rule out the virtual option?

Not yet, still need to fit together all the pieces. Let's kick back and discuss it over lunch!

Sounds good! Just don't let me freeze over waiting for you outside! The weather's starting to cloud over.

I'll be quick! Just need to put by some documentation and reel in a few more sponsors!
