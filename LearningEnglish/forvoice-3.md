Hey George, did you stop by that new ramen place? I've been wanting to eat out there.

Actually, I did! But don't get too excited - it's a total rip off. The noodles were starting to wear out my jaw, they were so chewy.

That's disappointing. I came across their reviews online and they seemed good. Speaking of food, want to hang around after the meeting? I need to talk over some Copilot features with you.

Sure! Just let me wrap up this documentation first. By the way, did you hear about that developer who tried to get away with using GPT-4 for all their code reviews?

Yeah, it totally fell apart when the code started to come apart! You can't just put down human review. Though I have to admit, AI has really started to grow on me.

Same here! Remember when we used to look down on AI assistance? Now I can't imagine having to do over all that boilerplate code manually.

True! Though sometimes I doze off when watching AI coding tutorials. Hey, did you find out what happened with yesterday's deployment?

Oh man, the server broke down completely. We had to call off the release and straighten out all the CI/CD pipelines. Sarah had to stay up all night to clear up the issues.

That's rough. We should probably think over our deployment strategy. I don't want to let down the team again.

Agreed. We need to cut down on these incidents. By the way, I'm planning to take off early today - need to see off my sister at the airport.

No problem! Before you go, can you help me fill out these GitHub Enterprise forms? I keep putting off the paperwork.

Sure, just hold on a second. Oh, and don't forget to reach out to the new interns - they're supposed to turn up tomorrow.

Right! I need to draw up their onboarding documents. I hope they don't drop out like the last batch.

They won't if we properly bring them along. Just make sure to open up about team culture and speak up when they need guidance.

Good point! Well, I should wind up this meeting. Need to check out those PR reviews before they pile up.

Alright, I'll get around to those deployment fixes tomorrow. Don't let the stress eat into your weekend!

Thanks! Let's carry out these improvements next sprint. See you tomorrow!
